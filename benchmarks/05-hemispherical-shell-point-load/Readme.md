  # Benchmark purpose
  The aim of this benchmark is to examine the $u_x$ of the shell at the point A. The target solution at this point is expected to be equal to 0.185 m
  # Material
  Linear elastic material model:
  - Young's modulus: 2.1e11 Pa
  - Poisson's ratio: 0.3
  # Boundary conditions and loads
  - symmetry along edge AE,
  - symmetry along edge CE,
  - $u_x=u_y=u_z=0$ at point E
  # Mesh
  Mesh descritization scheme can be found under this [link](http://www.caesarsystems.co.uk/NAFEMS_benchmarks/le3.html)
  # Results
  Results could be found [here](https://cofea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks/005-hemispherical-shell-point-load/results.html)
