# What is CoFEA?

> CoFEA is an initiative that aims to popularise application of open-source simulation software in solving real engineering problems. Even though CoFEA itself sounds like the magic drink which drives engineering minds, it is a combination of the words *cooperation* and *Finite Element Analysis*. The aim of the project is to create an environment where engineers could exchange theirs experience and knowledge of open-source simulation codes so that others could use them with joy and confidence. The following steps will be undertaken to achieve this goal:
> * numbers of benchmark and real-life problems will be analysed to increase confidence in using open-source software,
> * information on how to set up the simulation environment correctly will be gathered in one place, so anyone could set it up,
> * a simulation workflow enhanced by scripts & tools will be established to make usage of open-source tools easier,
> * message about the open-source software will be spread all over the internet to help the community grows,

# How to contribute?

There are plenty of ways on how you could contribute:

* if you know how to use simulation software then you can help to make models
* if you are good at writing then you can help writing the docs
* finally, if you don't think you have anything from the above, but you are eager to learn just let us know!

:::{important}
If you have some old FEA models which are validated experimentally and you could share them - do let us know! We will give them another life by checking them once again in the open-source software.
