# Benchmark updates

Few months have passed since the last update from CoFEA Initiative, but it does not mean nothing has been done. Quite contrary actually! We tested few models, improved the website and connected some dots to establish a simulation workflow based on available open-source software.

## Benchmark conclusions

Five simulation benchmarks modeled in Salome / Code_Aster, Calculix and Elmer gave us some insight on what these codes can do. It is definitely the case that we only scratched the surface, but the simple tests let us also to find out how easy is to setup a model and user-friendly a particular software is.

### User feeling
If user-friendliness is of interests then we have been quite positively surprised. The latest version of Salome-Meca is definitely one of the greatest environments which are available for free. Rumour has it that the French language has been a bit problematic for user to feel sure that they know what they do. The version available since 2019 has been translated into English quite well ('well' in non-native standards). Model can be built in it from scratch, meshed, solved and post-process. For users who know what to look for it will not take long to find the right tool. The others will not find the learning curve very steep as well.

As presented in the simulation workflow chart, we used mix of Salome-Meca, PrePoMax and Calculix Advanced Environment to build models for Calculix. It is very easy to build a final model in PrePoMax / CAE having already prepared mesh. It is worth saying that it wasn't that easy few years ago when these apps did not exist. Of course they have some glitches, like for example, the latest version of PrePoMax doesn't not allow to assign section in some situations... but at the end of the day they are quite handy and that's why it is worth checking them.

Elmer was the third code we were testing. The GUI looks very simple, but don't judge book by the cover. It actually contains the most important options which allow to set up solver, material, loads etc. Then user can add some options manually either using keyword editor or directly through text editor. What is worth saying is that Elmer does not always correctly imported the UNV file exported from Salome (90% cases were fine). If it could import node sets into the GUI then that would be very useful. Apart from that, it seems to us that the code has very strong capabilities if someone is interested in multiphysics simulation.

### Software accuracy
The most important conclusion about the results is that the free software can do a very good job. We achieved the target solutions in all of the tested cases. It can also be seen that in most of cases for the same mesh the results are very similar. We think that it might be due to a similar element implementation. For models of such small DOF number it was unreasonable to perform performance comparison, but there are plans to perform such tests in a future. It is also worth noting that we tried to make all the meshes as close as possible to the patterns recommended by NAFEMS.

It has been already proven that for a correct solution for the tuning fork benchmark can be obtained using Calculix, Code_Aster and Elmer. With this update we added result from test performed using MoFEM code. This Finite Element implementation uses some high-order element shape functions and they allow to achieve quite spectacular results even with coarser mesh. We would like to thank Lukasz Kaczmarczyk for running the eigenvalue analysis for this scenario.

The outcome from the thick plate under pressure case is that it is easy to achieve correct results for a linear model driven by pressure load. The target solution was achieved with both tetrahedral and hexahedral elements.

In the Cook's membrane benchmark, the semi-incompressible material was tested. Two values of Poisson's value were examined for the linear material model with low Young's modulus value. It turned out that it might not be feasible to use linear type of elements to obtain a decent solution. A solution closed to the target value was obtained with quadratic type elements.

With the elliptic membrane under pressure model the aim was to test the response from a study with the plane stress elements. The benchmark convinced us that it is fairly simple to set up a 2D model and achieve correct solution.

It can be said that the last model of the hemispherical shell point load model was the most cumbersome to examine. The tests with Code_Aster were quite straightforward, but it took a while to troubleshoot the response in both, Calculix and Elmer. The final conclusion from the tests with Calculix is that the shell implementation does not allow to achieve correct solution. It seems to us that the symmetry boundary condition has a significant impact on the accuracy of results. The correct solution was achieved with solid elements, which proved our setup being correct, but usage of those elements was not the point of the study. Setting up symmetry condition for shell elements in Elmer required some tests and the target value was eventually achieved, but for the model with very fine mesh only. The NAFEMS mesh setup do not allow to obtain a decent response, but it should also be noted that the shell implementation in Elmer is still in its' early phase of development. We would like to also say thank you to all people at the Elmer forum who helped us to debug the model.
