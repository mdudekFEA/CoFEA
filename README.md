# What is CoFEA?

[CoFEA](https://cofea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an initiative that aims to popularise application of open-source simulation software in solving real engineering problems. Even though CoFEA itself sounds like the magic drink which drives engineering minds, it is a combination of the words *cooperation* and *Finite Element Analysis*. The aim of the project is to create an environment where engineers could exchange theirs experience and knowledge of open-source simulation codes so that others could use them with joy and confidence. The following steps will be undertaken to achieve this goal:
* numbers of benchmark and real-life problems will be analysed to increase confidence in using open-source software,
* information on how to set up the simulation environment correctly will be gathered in one place, so anyone could set it up,
* a simulation workflow enhanced by scripts & tools will be established to make usage of open-source tools easier,
* message about the open-source software will be spread all over the internet to help the community grows.

# How to contribute?

There are plenty of ways on how you could contribute:

* if you know how to use simulation software then you can help to make models
* if you posses programming skills then you can help to develop CoFEA mesh converter
* if you are good at writing then you can help with writing the docs
* finally, if you don't think you have anything from the above, but you are eager to learn just let us know!

If you posses some old FEA models which are validated experimentally and you could share them - do let us know! We will give them another life by checking them once again in the open-source software.
